## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Saas/Scss

### What I learned

In this activity, I utilized and applied my knowledge of flexbox, the box model, and linear gradient backgrounds. This experience greatly assisted me in reinforcing and solidifying my skills.

<h1>Some Custom CSS I'm proud of</h1>

```css
:root {
 --primary-font: "Hanken Grotesk", sans-serif;
 --light-red: hsl(0, 100%, 67%);
 --orange-yellow: hsl(39, 100%, 56%);
 --grean-teal: hsl(166, 100%, 37%);
 --cobalt-blue: hsl(234, 85%, 45%);
 --primary-bg: hsl(252, 100%, 67%);
 --secondary-bg: hsl(241, 81%, 54%);
 --neutral-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
